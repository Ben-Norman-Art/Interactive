    <p style="color:white">This assignment was made most recently in my ART-101 class. This interactive avatar is a piece that is supposed to represent me, but it does not represent me but what I would want to be. I decided to move up to San Jose in order to get some independence and enjoy myself. But with COVID occurring and many stores and events shutting down. I wanted to make my avatar be able to enjoy the things that I canâ€™t right now. Such as going to concerts, music events, etc.
